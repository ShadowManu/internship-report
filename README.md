Internship Report - ZOMOZ Frontend Developer

<sub>Yeah, not the best of titles. But at least is not as common as thesis, or book.</sub>

Anyway, for anyone curious of what's in this repo, I'm working on the official document I'll show to the Universidad Simón Bolívar authorities and hopefully they'll think I did a good job and approve my internship so I can later graduate as a software engineer.

I've tried to use existing projects like [alemacgo/latex-templates](https://github.com/alemacgo/latex-templates), [talassio/tesis-usb](talassio/tesis-usb) or its updated derivation [angler-lang/angler-doc](https://github.com/angler-lang/angler-doc/tree/master/usb-book). When I get stuck, I will base my work on it, but I want to understand exaclty how my book is done and not some undocumented magic happening behind. So, I'm starting from scratch. Lets see how it goes.
